This plugin allows for the creation of an expanded-list styled page containing images and supporting detail, perfect for a portfolio presentation.

== Description ==

The WEBphysiology Portfolio plugin was built to provide a clean, current look in situations where an expanded list-style portfolio layout is appropriate. The plugin is implemented via a [shortcode] that supports specifying one-or-more portfolio types, all portfolio-types or all but one excluded portfolio type.

The plugin utilizes a Custom Post Type as well as a Custom Taxonomy. It provides a Settings page for specifying some customizable options, like the number of entries to display per page. It also allows one to turn off the provided CSS in place of implementing their own.

The Portfolio entry screen is highly customized to include just the items that make up a Portfolio entry. Attributes that arenâ€™t populated will not be displayed on the end user interface. Attaching an image to a Portfolio entry also has been made relatively painless.

The end user interface can be adjusted somewhat using the Admin Settings values or via your own CSS. It also incorporates the TimThumb.php code in order to scale the images displayed in the list. The benefit here is to decrease the page weight while maintaining an acceptable quality image, plus the fact that you only need to load one image for use in the list thumbnail and expanded view. The end user interface also utilizes FancyBox to present the full-sized image in a lightbox fashion.

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Extract the WEBphysiology Portfolio ZIP file and place the `webphysiology-portfolio` folder into the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Specifying a 'portfolio_type' in the shortcode is not working. Why? =

Double-check that the code you are specifying is the correct one.  For example, if you've used the same Portfolio Type as a Tag, chances are the slug on your portfolio type had a number appended, even though you didn't type it in when you added the type.
